# Nexmo Quickstart Examples for Node.JS

The purpose of the quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused
on one goal. For example, sending and SMS, handling and incoming SMS webhook,
making a Text to Speech call.

## Setup

To use this sample you will first need a [Nexmo account][sign-up]. Then rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

For some of the examples you will need to [buy a number][buy-number].

## Running the Examples

Run the examples using the following replacing `/path/to/example.js` with a path
to a real file:

```sh
node /path/to/example.js
```

## Request an Example

Please [raise and issue](/issues) to request an example that isn't present within
the quickstart. Pull requests will be gratefully received.
